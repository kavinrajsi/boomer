<p>While we take utmost care to deliver your order to the best of our efforts, we understand that unexpected damage or other factors might arise causing the need to return/exchange/cancel your order. Our returns and exchange policy is designed specifically to provide an opportunity for you to return or exchange the products purchased due to unforeseen or unavoidable circumstances. Please go through the structure of our policy thoroughly and get in touch with our customer service team for any queries regarding the same.</p>
<h3>REFUNDS</h3>
<p>Please note, all refunds will be processed through the bank account through which the purchase order has been made, after deducting the transaction charges.</p>
<p>If the product ordered by you runs out of stock, the amount will be refunded to your account or you can choose another product of the same value. Our Customer Care Team will send you an email to obtain consent and initiate the refund/exchange process.</p>
<p>If you have ordered several products, and one or more of those products are not in stock, you will be able to avail a refund totalling the cost of the products that are not available.</p>
<p>If the size requested by you is not available for exchange, refund can be availed.</p>
<p>If the product was damaged during the shipping process, we request you to inform our customer service team at the time of delivery itself as it will help us to coordinate with the courier team and proceed further. In this case, the postal charges will be refunded to you along with the product value. The replacement of the damaged product is dependent on the nature of the damage and the report submitted by the courier. You can either choose to have the payment refunded to your account or you can choose another product of the same value.</p>
<p>Refunds will be processed through our secure payment gateway for all products that are ordered through Credit/Debit cards. These payments will be routed back and credited to your account.</p>
<p>Refunds of payments made through Demand Draft/Cheque will be shipped through our courier partner.</p>
<p>Refunds will be initiated only after the product couriered by you reaches us in a saleable condition.</p>
<h3>STORE CREDITS</h3>
<p>The colour resolution on your screen might slightly vary from the actual product. Kindly note that this colour variation will not be considered as a reason for refund and you will be given a store credit.</p>
<p>If the product received does not meet your expectations due to an unfortunate reason, you can return it to us within a week from the delivery date. Kindly note that the postal charges will have to be borne by you. A store credit will be processed once the product has been received and only if it is in a saleable condition.</p>
<h3>CANCELLATION</h3>
<p>In the unfortunate event that you wish to cancel your order, kindly do so within 24 hours of placing the order to avail refund.</p>
<p>If you had made the payment through PayPal 5% will be deducted from the total refund amount. If you had paid through other payment modes, 2.5% will be deducted from the total refund amount.</p>
<p>Orders, where the shipping has been initiated, cannot be cancelled. Alternatively you can choose another product of the same value or you will be issued a store credit.</p>
